<p>Here’s another edition of my newsletter, <em>The Life of the Shy IT Guy!</em> It’s heartfelt because this is my first edition after one year as a new Mormon Priest. I say that loosely because everyone in the media calls followers of our Christianity “Mormons,” when really that’s not our name. We’re “Saints” who follow the “Church of Christ” (the shortened name websites often use in their menus), and our formal name is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The title challenges electronic databases because most save space by limiting the length of their fields. So, our name doesn’t fit in many of them. Isn’t that very IT?</p>

<p>Today, I’m introducing something I’ve worked on since 1984, when I first started DJ-ing at home. Back then, I DJ-ed with eight-track tapes my dad bought and a single record player he let me keep in my room next to the eight-track.</p>

<p>My dad was an IT guy at heart, and a Military Sergeant. He kept his military career a secret, and I only found out about it after his passing. He gave me his farewell and personal praise in his last words, which were told to me confidentially as I placed his urn in its final resting place—at his personal request from his hospital bed to the Military. He loved me and said I was his favorite son, but it wasn’t fair to the others to say it while he was living. He admitted it was really hard for him not to. My dad had deep integrity. Only as I’ve grown older, in my fifties, have I understood how truly harsh life can be—when age blends with obstacles and youth is no longer such an advantage.</p>

<p>Now that you know what I’ve been up to and how deep my experiences go, you can imagine what my DJ-mix’d Diaries will say.</p>

<p>I’ll tell you the first one, which is also the most recent: <em>Unlimited Love Bombs.</em> It’s a playlist right now, with these tracks, and it chronicles a few select “catfish” who love-bombed me into giving them money (a very small amount, because I don’t trust strangers) until I managed to prove they were stealing someone else’s pictures—by outing them to the real person. That person then told me the account was fake.</p>

<p>It’s not easy to tell when a catfish is lying unless you can use IT-level tools to prove it. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, but when it comes to social media, it’s smarter and wiser to reverse that: “judge a book by its cover” and presume guilt before innocence.</p>

<p>So, I did that and kept the person talking until I proved their motive. This is how IT people can make a difference—by sharing tactics used to catch catfish in their tracks and exposing their methods to those who may not be as fortunate to know how.</p>

<p>I hope you’ll listen to my DJ-mix’d Diary, <em>Unlimited Love Bombs</em>, over at my DJ site, <a href="https://djx.vegas" target="_blank">https://djx.vegas</a>. There, I’ll talk about it in the playlist’s track list, showing how each track represents what the love-bomber was trying to do to turn me into a fool—but failed, because I was suspicious all along.</p>

<p>“Love thieves” should learn that the game goes both ways. While I may be their target for getting into my wallet, they become my target for exposing their real information—such as the social media accounts they used to catfish me—to anyone I choose, anywhere I want. Two can play that game. But only one will win.</p>

<p>Especially when I take it all the way to court. Even the real people whose identities are stolen by catfish are often too busy with their lives to deal with them, especially when there are dozens of impersonators. So, it falls to someone else—in this case, me, some “nobody IT guy”—to do something.</p>

<p>Stay safe out there on the “inter-web.” It’s a jungle!</p>

<p>When this latest playlist has its own page, I’ll update this edition to show it here. It will get its own page once I turn it into a full DJ mix. This is how I build my mixes: a story first, then a playlist, then a studio-produced DJ-mixed experience. I never perform live—I’m too shy for that.</p>
